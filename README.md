Using the Endpoint Explorer, various HTTP requests were sent to perform CRUD operations, generating a PersonApi.http file.

The HTTP methods used include GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT:

GET retrieves data.
POST sends data to create a new entry.
DELETE removes an entry from the dataset.
PUT is used when it is unclear whether the data exists. If the entry exists, it updates it; otherwise, it creates a new one.

The ID is crucial, serving as a unique identifier for each entry in the dataset.
